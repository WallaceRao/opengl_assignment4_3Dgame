This is the assignment 4 of Computer Graphics.

Implementation

#1
This is a simple 3D game, you will control a flying monster to cross
enermies without hitting them.
The model of the character is downloaded from https://www.turbosquid.com.
The program loads the model via assimp.

#2 
Collision detection is implemented by checking distance of enemy and
and host, if it is shorter than 1.1, collision happens.
The host lose one life and change its color after each collision.
The game is over after the host losing 3 lives.

#3
The enermy locations are generated randomly, they will move toward
the host, thus it looks like the host is flying towards enermies.

#4
The Phong lighting is appiled

#5
The background has a texture of sky.jpg, no texture is applied for monster models,
since there are several texture pictures and I am not sure which picture should be used.

#6 
Perspective projection is used in this program.

#7 
The game supports 5 different camera postions, up/down/left/right/back. By default,
the camera is at the back of the host.


How to play

#1 Press arrow keys to control the host.
#2 Press space key to pause/resume the game.
#3 Press 'r' to reset the game if the host lose all lives.
#4 Press 'w, s, a, d, b' to change the camera positions.
#5 Press 'Esc' to exit the game
